# Dialogues, part II

## Begin at the beginning. Where's that?

### Act I

*[Mercutio and Tybalt enter, stage right]*

**Tybalt:** I think we made some good choices on SP/CM/CI/CD tools, before driving the gondola right off a cliff talking about agile.

**Mercutio:** Yes, and we need to get back to that. But for now, we need to get focus and apply some discipline to our stack provisioning.

**T:** That's Terraform. I stand by my earlier comment. It's a rich vein. The problem is our tendency to get distracted.

**M:** Yes. We stand up a few simple stacks and then get caught up with valid but unrelated tasks. For example, where to store keys. And mulling over a stack architecture.

**T:** Both are valid.

**M:** Yes, but both are off-topic. I'll grant that we need a stack architecture, but how elaborate does it have to be?

**T:** We said we'd run a single Jenkins server with the master and build node on the same instance. We also said we'd use AWS. Can't get simpler than that.

**M:** Okay. I think we've got that or something that could be that almost ready to go already. The keys issue is still unresolved, however.

**T:** Hold on now. We've got something "almost ready to go". That's necessary but not sufficient. We need to set up a Git repo and get it up there. I think the stack files should live in a subdirectory so we have room to grow.

**M:** Sounds great. It's a two-point story or less. Can we time box it to an hour?

**T:** Sounds like some of that agile talk sunk in. Yes, let's time box it. One hour.
