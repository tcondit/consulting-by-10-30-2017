# Create a SP/CM/CI/CD Portfolio

As a developer and fact-finder, I would like to put together a full-stack application pipeline with room to grow expansively.

## A/C:
* Explain user benefits, in press-release driven development style.
* Describe functional requirements. Keep in mind for this one, they're mostly about learning a bunch of tools.

## DoD:

## Notes:
* This will be a **"live portfolio"** to show and talk about with future employers (hopefully multiple).

# Press Release

Timazon is excited to announce release of a core portfolio demonstrating experience and skill with a number of software development and CI/CD tools.

The first pieces to be released include:

* Application
  * A password manager
    * **It's a CI/CD delivery vehicle only! Please don't use it to hold your real secrets!**
    * For now it'll be either [passgo](https://github.com/ejcx/passgo) or [visionary](https://github.com/libeclipse/visionary)
    * TODO write a proper list of functional requirements (e.g., database, a language that needs to be "built", etc.)


* Build Infrastructure
  * Terraform scripts to create a Jenkins build environment on AWS
    * Container-based?
    * Switch to DroneCI later?
  * Ansible scripts to do the server provisioning


* Deployment Infrastructure
  * Terraform scripts to create an AWS stack on which to deploy and run the password manager
    * 'Splain?


*

Bonus: Included with this initial release is a roadmap for future work.
